# mgwt-traffic-flow

The [Seattle Traffic Flow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imaginedreal.trafficflow) app is an HTML5 Web application targeting WebKit based browsers and is available for free on the Google Play Store.

The app is an experiment in an attempt to assist those who have a color vision deficiency. One who is color vision deficient has a decreased ability to see color, or perceive color differences. This is potentially problematic if you are trying to differentiate traffic conditions on a map based on a color scheme.

The application is built using:

  * [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/)
  * [mGWT - Mobile GWT](https://github.com/mgwt/mgwt)
  * [GWT-PhoneGap](https://github.com/mgwt/gwtphonegap)
  * [GWT-HTML5-Database](https://github.com/waynedyck/gwt-html5-database) for the Web SQL database
