# mgwt-traffic-flow

The [Seattle Traffic Flow](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.imaginedreal.trafficflow) app is an HTML5 Web application targeting WebKit based browsers and is available for free on the Google Play Store.

The app is a bit of an experiment in an attempt to assist those who have a color vision deficiency. One who is color vision deficient has a decreased ability to see color, or perceive color differences. This is potentially problematic if you are trying to differentiate traffic conditions on a map based on a color scheme.

The application is built using:

  * [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/)
  * [mGWT - Mobile GWT](https://github.com/mgwt/mgwt)
  * [GWT-PhoneGap](https://code.google.com/p/gwt-phonegap/)
  * [GWT-HTML5-Database](https://github.com/waynedyck/gwt-html5-database) for the Web SQL database
  * [Color Picker Dialog](http://www.subshell.com/en/subshell/blog/Implementing-a-Color-Picker-Dialog-With-Canvas-and-GWT100.html) widget for implementing the color picker
